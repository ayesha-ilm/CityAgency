# City Website Privacy Policy Analysis

# Overview
This project investigates how U.S. city websites collect, handle, and disclose user data.
While privacy in smart cities and digital services is widely studied, municipal websites - where citizens routinely access vital services - often escape scrutiny. This research aims to bridge that gap.
By scraping, archiving, and analyzing privacy policies and terms of service from city websites, the project identifies:

1. What types of personal data are collected
2. How the data is stored, shared, or sold
3. Compliance with state/federal privacy laws
4. Transparency in disclosures to citizens

# Motivation
Residents increasingly interact with city services online - paying utility bills, applying for permits, accessing records - often without realizing the extent of data collection.
However, city governments typically lack robust privacy governance frameworks and may outsource services to third-party vendors, introducing new risks.
Existing literature and reports (e.g., Balancing Privacy and Innovation in Smart Cities and Communities, ITIF, 2023) highlight resource constraints and governance gaps in municipal data protection.
